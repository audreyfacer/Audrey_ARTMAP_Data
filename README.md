## Usage

This is a Python project, so a working Python environment is required.
A virtual environment manager is recommended, such as [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
For example, download the [miniforge distribution](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for your OS.

Next, create a virtual environment like so:

```shell
mamba create -n audrey python=3.12
```

Activate that environment with

```shell
mamba activate audrey
```

and install the python dependencies once you're inside that environment with

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
